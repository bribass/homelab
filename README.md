# Homelab

This repository contains configuration and maintenance scripts for my homelab.

## Hardware

The lab system is centralized on a single host, with the following components:

|   | Component |
| - | --------- |
| Motherboard/CPU | [Minisforum BD795i SE](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DQ8WXMKP) with AMD Ryzen 9 7945HX |
| RAM | 64GB |
| Case | [Jonsbo N3](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CMVBMVHT) |
| Storage Controller | [LSI SAS2308 HBA](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BXPWJLM6) |
| Storage | 8x various SATA NAS drives (4x WD Red, 4x Seagate IronWolf) |
|         | 512 GB NVMe SSD (for operating system) |
| Network | [Intel 82599 10GbE](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DGV4WQTJ) and [SFP+ modules](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B077T46LPJ) |
| Operating System | [Proxmox VE](https://proxmox.com) 9.0 |

The system was inspired by [Alex](https://github.com/IronicBadger/pms-wiki)'s [Perfect Media Server](https://perfectmediaserver.com) project,
and component selection included influences from various PC hardware YouTubers
([NASCompares](https://youtu.be/en7R_HB5pm4),
 [Wendell of Level 1 Techs](https://youtu.be/M0p8HMeO_WI), and
 [Hardware Haven](https://youtu.be/i3G_LvowBkI)).

## Ansible

The homelab is configured using [Ansible](https://www.redhat.com/en/ansible-collaborative).  Each physical
machine, virtual machine, or LXC container will have a single playbook (`services/*/ansible.yaml`) that
configures all services required for the host to fulfill it's purpose.

* Each playbook should be run from the top-level directory of this repository:
    ```
    $ ansible-playbook services/hostname/ansible.yaml
    ```
* Debugging of the playbooks can (mostly) be handled using Ansible's `--check` and `--verbose` options:
    ```
    $ ansible-playbook --check -vvv services/hostname/ansible.yaml
    ```
* Passwords are stored as Vault-encrypted entries in the variables file located at `ansible/inventory/group_vars/all`.
  To add a new password as an encrypted variable:
    1. Run:
        ```
        $ ansible-vault encrypt_string --stdin-name xxx >> ansible/inventory/group_vars/all
        New Vault password: *****
        Confirm Vault password: *****
        [[ no prompt; enter password to store, followed by Ctrl-D twice ]]
        ````
    2. Edit the variables file `ansible/inventory/group_vars/all` to rename the variable to the correct 
        name, and correctly indent it to match the YAML formatting (only the line with `!vault` should be
        indented; leave the encrypted portion indented as generated by the `ansible-vault` tool).

    To decrypt individual passwords outside of a playbook, simply pipe them through `ansible-vault decrypt`:
    ```
    $ yq '.passwd.auth.mgr' ansible/inventory/group_vars/all | ansible-vault decrypt
    Vault password: *****
    Decryption successful
    [[ password printed on standard output ]]
    ```

    Because of this setup, in order to run any playbook in this repository, it is required to decrypt the
    vault.  This password is not avilable in the repository (obviously :grin:)
